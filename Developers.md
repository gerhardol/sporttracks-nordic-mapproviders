This is not a general SportTracks plugin description. See for instance [here](http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks/Forums/viewtopic.php?t=4828) for more information about developing ST plugins.

Most of the plugin development setup is the same as for gps-running plugins, see here:

See the link also for [translations](https://code.google.com/p/gps-running/wiki/Developers#Translations).o
